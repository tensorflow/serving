# TF Serving C++ API Docs

**Welcome to the TensorFlow Serving C++ API documentation!**

TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine
learning models, designed for production environments. It deals with the
*inference* aspect of machine learning, taking models after *training* and
managing their lifetimes, providing clients with versioned access via a
high-performance, reference-counted lookup table. TensorFlow Serving provides
out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to
serve other types of models and data.
