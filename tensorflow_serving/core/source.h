// An abstraction for a module that sources servables to load, or, more
// precisely, handles to data that can be used to load those servables.
// Examples of such data handles are:
//  - a file-system path to a serialized vocabulary map
//  - a handle to an incoming RPC that specifies a machine-learned model to load
//  - a Loader (see loader.h)
// The data handles are generally assumed to be small.
//
// A Source monitors some external resource (e.g. file system, RPC calls) to
// find out about new servables and/or new versions of servables and/or the
// need to unload servable versions. It uses the provided callback to instruct
// another module (e.g. AspiredVersionsManager) which version(s) of a given
// servable to
// load (and implicitly which ones to unload).
//
// A common case is that a Source emits versions for exactly one servable. An
// even simpler case is that a servable has a single, static version for the
// lifetime of the server.
//
// Sources can house state that is shared among multiple emitted servables, e.g.
//  1. A shared thread pool or other resource that multiple servables use.
//  2. A shared read-only data structure that multiple servables use, to avoid
//     the time and space overhead of replicating the data structure in each
//     servable instance.
// Shared state whose initialization time and size is negligible (e.g. thread
// pools) can be created eagerly by the source, which then embeds a pointer to
// it in each emitted ServableData item. Creation of expensive or large shared
// state should be deferred to the first applicable Loader::Load() call, i.e.
// governed by the manager. Symmetrically, the Loader::Unload() call to the
// final servable using the expensive/large shared state should tear it down.

  // A callback for sources to use to specify which version(s) of a given
  // servable should be loaded. A single invocation of the callback pertains to
  // a single servable stream (given by 'servable_name'), and specifies all the
  // versions (if any) the recipient should aim to have loaded. Implicitly, the
  // recipient should aim to unload any currently-loaded versions that are
  // absent from the list.
  //
  // All versions supplied in a call must be for the servable identified in
  // 'servable_name'.
  //
  // Each call is independent. A call with servable name P does not influence
  // the aspired version set of any other servable. A subsequent call with P
  // supercedes all prior calls.
  //
  // First example call sequence:
  //  callback(A, {A1})      // Aspire to load version 1 of servable A.
  //  callback(B, {B1, B2})  // Aspire to load versions 1 and 2 of servable B.
  //  callback(A, {A2})      // Aspire to unload A1 and load A2.
  //  callback(B, {})        // Aspire to unload all versions of servable B.
  //
  // Second example call sequence:
  //  callback(A, {A1})      // Aspire to load version 1 of servable A.
  //  callback(A, {A1, A2})  // Aspire to load versions 1 and 2 of servable A.
  //  callback(A, {A2})      // Aspire to unload A1.
  //
  //
  // Multiple callback calls may supply servable-data objects with identical
  // ids, as shown in the second example sequence above, in which separate
  // objects with id A1 are supplied in two separate callback calls. Those two
  // servable-data objects are treated as semantically equivalent. The recipient
  // will ultimately discard one of them.
