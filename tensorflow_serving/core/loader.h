// A standardized abstraction for an object that manages the lifecycle of a
// servable, including loading and unloading it. Servables are arbitrary objects
// that serve algorithms or data that often, though not necessarily, use a
// machine-learned model.
//
// A Loader for a servable object represents one instance of a stream of
// servable versions, all sharing a common name (e.g. "my_servable") and
// increasing version numbers, typically representing updated model parameters
// learned from fresh training data.
//
// A Loader should start in an unloaded state, meaning that no work has been
// done to prepare to perform operations. A typical instance that has not yet
// been loaded contains merely a pointer to a location from which its data can
// be loaded (e.g. a file-system path or network location). Construction and
// destruction of instances should be fairly cheap. Expensive initialization
// operations should be done in Load().
//
// Subclasses may optionally store a pointer to the Source that originated it,
// for accessing state shared across multiple servable objects in a given
// servable stream.
//
// Implementations need to ensure that the methods they expose are thread-safe,
// or carefully document and/or coordinate their thread-safety properties with
// their clients to ensure correctness.
// Servables do not need to worry about concurrent execution of Load()/Unload()
// as the caller will ensure that does not happen.

  // If the servable has already been loaded, returns an estimate of the actual
  // resource usage.
  //
  // IMPORTANT: This method's implementation must obey following requirements,
  // which enable the serving system to reason correctly about which servables
  // can be loaded safely:
  //  1. The estimate must represent an upper bound on the actual value.
  //  2. Prior to load, the estimate may include resources that are not bound
  //     to any specific device instance, e.g. RAM on one of the two GPUs.
  //  3. While loaded, for any devices with multiple instances (e.g. two GPUs),
  //     the estimate must specify the instance to which each resource is bound.
  //  4. The estimate must be monotonically non-increasing, i.e. it cannot
  //     increase over time.

  // binding of resources to specific device instances must take into account
  // the availability on each instance, given by 'available_resources'.

  virtual void Unload() = 0;

  // Returns an opaque interface to the underlying servable object.
  // The caller should know the precise type of the interface in order to make
  // actual use of it. For example:

  //     ...
  //     Status Load() override {
  //       servable_ = ...;

  //

  //     CustomServable* servable_ = nullptr;

  //
  // Serving user request:
  //
  //   ServableHandle<CustomServable> handle = ...
  //   CustomServable* servable = handle.get();
  //   servable->...
  //
  // If servable() is called after successful Load() and before Unload(), it
  // returns a valid, non-null AnyPtr object. If called before a successful
  // Load() call or after Unload(), it returns null AnyPtr.

// an 'available_resources' argument. Its EstimateResources() method returns 0,
