  /// \brief Returns a callback to set the list of aspired versions for a
  /// particular servable stream, using Loaders.
  //
  // AspiredVersionsManager's semantics with respect to this callback are as
  // follows:
  //
  // 1. OMITTING A VERSION INSTRUCTS THE MANAGER TO UNLOAD IT
  //
  // An invocation of the callback for servable stream S specifies all the
  // versions of S (if any) the manager should aim to have loaded. Each callback
  // invocation for S supercedes any prior invocations for S. Versions of S
  // supplied in previous invocations that are omitted from the latest
  // invocation will be unloaded. An invocation for S supplying an empty version
  // list causes the manager to unload all versions of S.
  //
  // First example call sequence:
  //  callback(A, {A1})      // Aspire to load version 1 of servable A.
  //  callback(B, {B1, B2})  // Aspire to load versions 1 and 2 of servable B.
  //  callback(A, {A2})      // Aspire to unload A1 and load A2.
  //  callback(B, {})        // Aspire to unload all versions of servable B.
  //
  // Second example call sequence:
  //  callback(A, {A1})      // Aspire to load version 1 of servable A.
  //  callback(A, {A1, A2})  // Aspire to load versions 1 and 2 of servable A.
  //  callback(A, {A2})      // Aspire to unload A1.
  //
  //
  // 2. Load()/Unload() CALLS GO TO A SINGLE LOADER OBJECT
  //
  // In general, multiple callback calls may supply a loader object for a given
  // servable id. Once the manager calls Load() on one of those loaders, its
  // next call for that id will be to the same loader's Unload() method. (In
  // other words, bracketed Load() and Unload() calls will be to the same loader
  // object.)
  //
  //
  // 3. NO SPONTANEOUS UNLOADING
  //
  // The manager aims to evolve the loadedness states of the servable objects it
  // manages to match the aspired list, but at a given point in time the two may
  // not coincide. That is because (a) loading/unloading are not instantaneous
  // operations, (b) loading can fail, and (c) the manager reserves the right to
  // refuse to load a servable version in the aspired list e.g. due to resource
  // limitations.
  //
  // However, the manager does obey the following constraint: Once it has loaded
  // a given servable version V, as long as V is present in the latest aspired
  // list it cannot unload V. One purpose of this guarantee is to facilitate
  // incremental loading, in which version V's Load() implementation arranges to
  // copy state from (or share state with) and already-loaded version V-1 (or
  // any prior version(s) that are loaded, for that matter). As long as V-1 is
  // currently loaded, and remains part of the aspired list, V can rely on V-1
  // remaining loaded.
