# Serving a TensorFlow Model

This tutorial shows you how to use TensorFlow Serving components to export a
trained TensorFlow model and use the standard tensorflow_model_server to serve
it. If you are already familiar with TensorFlow Serving, and you want to know
more about how the server internals work, see the
[TensorFlow Serving advanced tutorial](serving_advanced.md).

This tutorial uses the simple Softmax Regression model introduced in the
TensorFlow tutorial for handwritten image (MNIST data) classification. If you
do not know what TensorFlow or MNIST is, see the
[MNIST For ML Beginners](http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html#mnist-for-ml-beginners)
tutorial.

The code for this tutorial consists of two parts:

*   A Python file,
    [mnist_saved_model.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/tree/master/tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_saved_model.py),
    that trains and exports the model.

*   A ModelServer binary which can be either installed using Apt, or compiled
    from a C++ file
    ([main.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/tree/master/tensorflow_serving/model_servers/main.cc)).
    The TensorFlow Serving ModelServer discovers new exported models and runs a
    [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io) service for serving them.

Before getting started, first [install Docker](docker.md#installing-docker).

## Train and export TensorFlow model

As you can see in `mnist_saved_model.py`, the training is done the same way it
is in the
[MNIST For ML Beginners tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners).
The TensorFlow graph is launched in TensorFlow session `sess`, with the input
tensor (image) as `x` and output tensor (Softmax score) as `y`.

Then we use TensorFlow's [SavedModelBuilder module](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/builder.py)
to export the model. `SavedModelBuilder` saves a "snapshot" of the trained model
to reliable storage so that it can be loaded later for inference.

For details on the SavedModel format, please see the documentation at
[SavedModel README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/README.md).

From [mnist_saved_model.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/tree/master/tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_saved_model.py),
the following is a short code snippet to illustrate the general process of
saving a model to disk.

```python
export_path_base = sys.argv[-1]
export_path = os.path.join(
      compat.as_bytes(export_path_base),
      compat.as_bytes(str(FLAGS.model_version)))
print 'Exporting trained model to', export_path
builder = tf.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder(export_path)
builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
      sess, [tf.saved_model.tag_constants.SERVING],
      signature_def_map={
           'predict_images':
               prediction_signature,
           signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY:
               classification_signature,
      },
      main_op=main_op)
builder.save()
```

`SavedModelBuilder.__init__` takes the following argument:

* `export_path` is the path of the export directory.

`SavedModelBuilder` will create the directory if it does not exist. In the
example, we concatenate the command line argument and `FLAGS.model_version` to
obtain the export directory. `FLAGS.model_version` specifies the **version** of
the model. You should specify a larger integer value when exporting a newer
version of the same model. Each version will be exported to a different
sub-directory under the given path.

You can add meta graph and variables to the builder using
`SavedModelBuilder.add_meta_graph_and_variables()` with the following arguments:

*   `sess` is the TensorFlow session that holds the trained model you are
    exporting.

*   `tags` is the set of tags with which to save the meta graph. In this case,
    since we intend to use the graph in serving, we use the `serve` tag from
    predefined SavedModel tag constants. For more details, see
    [tag_constants.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/tag_constants.py)
    and
    [related TensorFlow API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/tag_constants).

*   `signature_def_map` specifies the map of user-supplied key for a
    **signature** to a tensorflow::SignatureDef to add to the meta graph.
    Signature specifies what type of model is being exported, and the
    input/output tensors to bind to when running inference.

    The special signature key `serving_default` specifies the default serving
    signature. The default serving signature def key, along with other constants
    related to signatures, are defined as part of SavedModel signature
    constants. For more details, see
    [signature_constants.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/signature_constants.py)
    and related
    [TensorFlow 1.0 API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/signature_constants).

    Further, to help build signature defs easily, the SavedModel API provides
    [signature def utils](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/signature_def_utils).
    Specifically, in the original
    [mnist_saved_model.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/tree/master/tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_saved_model.py)
    file, we use `signature_def_utils.build_signature_def()` to build
    `predict_signature` and `classification_signature`.

    As an example for how `predict_signature` is defined, the util takes the
    following arguments:

    *   `inputs={'images': tensor_info_x}` specifies the input tensor info.

    *   `outputs={'scores': tensor_info_y}` specifies the scores tensor info.

    *   `method_name` is the method used for the inference. For Prediction
        requests, it should be set to `tensorflow/serving/predict`. For other
        method names, see
        [signature_constants.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/signature_constants.py)
        and related
        [TensorFlow 1.0 API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/signature_constants).

Note that `tensor_info_x` and `tensor_info_y` have the structure of
`tensorflow::TensorInfo` protocol buffer defined [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/protobuf/meta_graph.proto).
To easily build tensor infos, the TensorFlow SavedModel API also provides
[utils.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/utils.py),
with [related TensorFlow 1.0 API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/utils).

Also, note that `images` and `scores` are tensor alias names. They can be
whatever unique strings you want, and they will become the logical names
of tensor `x` and `y` that you refer to for tensor binding when sending
prediction requests later.

For instance, if `x` refers to the tensor with name 'long_tensor_name_foo' and
`y` refers to the tensor with name 'generated_tensor_name_bar', `builder` will
store tensor logical name to real name mapping ('images' ->
'long_tensor_name_foo') and ('scores' -> 'generated_tensor_name_bar').  This
allows the user to refer to these tensors with their logical names when
running inference.

Note: In addition to the description above, documentation related to signature
def structure and how to set up them up can be found [here](signature_defs.md).

Let's run it!

First, if you haven't done so yet, clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/serving.git
cd serving
```

Clear the export directory if it already exists:

```shell
rm -rf /tmp/mnist
```

Now let's train the model:

```shell
tools/run_in_docker.sh python tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_saved_model.py \
  /tmp/mnist
```

This should result in output that looks like:

```console
Training model...

...

Done training!
Exporting trained model to models/mnist
Done exporting!
```

Now let's take a look at the export directory.

```console
$ ls /tmp/mnist
1
```

As mentioned above, a sub-directory will be created for exporting each version
of the model. `FLAGS.model_version` has the default value of 1, therefore
the corresponding sub-directory `1` is created.

```console
$ ls /tmp/mnist/1
saved_model.pb variables
```

Each version sub-directory contains the following files:

  * `saved_model.pb` is the serialized tensorflow::SavedModel. It includes
  one or more graph definitions of the model, as well as metadata of the
  model such as signatures.

  * `variables` are files that hold the serialized variables of the graphs.

With that, your TensorFlow model is exported and ready to be loaded!

## Load exported model with standard TensorFlow ModelServer

Use a Docker serving image to easily load the model for serving:

```shell
docker run -p 8500:8500 \
--mount type=bind,source=/tmp/mnist,target=/models/mnist \
-e MODEL_NAME=mnist -t tensorflow/serving &
```

## Test the server

We can use the provided
[mnist_client](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/tree/master/tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_client.py)
utility to test the server. The client downloads MNIST test data, sends them as
requests to the server, and calculates the inference error rate.

```shell
tools/run_in_docker.sh python tensorflow_serving/example/mnist_client.py \
  --num_tests=1000 --server=127.0.0.1:8500
```

This should output something like

```console
    ...
    Inference error rate: 11.13%
```

We expect around 90% accuracy for the trained Softmax model and we get 11%
inference error rate for the first 1000 test images. This confirms that the
server loads and runs the trained model successfully!
