"""A client that performs inferences on a ResNet model using the REST API.

The client downloads a test image of a cat, queries the server over the REST API
with the test image repeatedly and measures how long it takes to respond.

The client expects a TensorFlow Serving ModelServer running a ResNet SavedModel
from:

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet#pre-trained-model

The SavedModel must be one that can take JPEG images as inputs.

Typical usage example:

    resnet_client.py
