"""Exports a toy linear regression inference graph.

Exports a TensorFlow graph to /tmp/half_plus_two/ based on the Exporter
format, https://goo.gl/OIDCqz.

This graph calculates,
  y = a*x + b
where a and b are variables with a=0.5 and b=2.

Output from this program is typically used to exercise Session
loading and execution code.
